**Overview:**

AI is the operative layer converting MobilityCorp’s raw telemetry, usage signals, and customer data into operational decisions and revenue levers. Forecasting models predict demand at bay-level granularity; battery-depletion models prioritize swaps for scooters and bikes; vision and OCR models validate returns and charger-plug status; NLP and classification automate feedback triage and fraud detection; recommender and personalized pricing drive subscription adoption; routing and vehicle-rebalancing optimization assigns staff tasks. Models run as real-time inference for operational control and as batched analytics for strategic planning. The architecture below integrates these AI services into a resilient telemetry-first MobilityCorp platform.

**Example Data Flow (Booking Lifecycle)**

1. **User** requests booking via app → API Gateway → Booking Service.
1. **Booking Service** validates availability via Vehicle Management.
1. Booking created → emits booking.created event → Billing, Fleet Ops, and Analytics services subscribe.
1. On trip end, **Return Verification** consumes photo → validates → emits return.completed.
1. **Billing** finalizes charges, triggers payment.
1. **Feedback Service** awaits user input → NLP classification → opens ticket if needed.
1. **Fleet Ops** consumes return event → updates vehicle state, triggers maintenance or swap task if flagged by model.
-----
**Data flows (concise)**

1. MobilityCorp vehicle → telemetry → ingestion bus → stream enrichment → realtime state store + time-series DB + event lake.
1. MobilityCorp mobile app → booking/payment → Booking Service → ACID commit in Postgres → event emitted to bus.
1. Streaming models consume telemetry and bay state → emit swap priorities / anomaly alerts → Staff Ops & Routing Optimizer.
1. Photo uploaded at return → Vision inference (synchronous) → Returns Service marks accepted/rejected and triggers fines if MobilityCorp policy requires.
1. Batch pipelines train/retrain models from event lake → validated in staging → promoted to production via model registry.

**AI specifics — models, inputs, outputs, evaluation**

- Demand forecasting
  - Inputs: historical MobilityCorp rentals (bay-level), time features, weather, transit schedules, events, promotions.
  - Outputs: demand probability per bay per 15-min interval; uncertainty bands.
  - Eval: MAPE & calibration; operational KPI: reduced unmet demand for MobilityCorp.
- Battery prioritization
  - Inputs: telemetry (SOC, trip energy), trip history, ambient temperature, charger availability.
  - Outputs: swap-priority score + ETA-to-empty for MobilityCorp techs.
  - Eval: precision/recall for outages prevented; KPI: reduction in mid-trip failures for MobilityCorp.
- Returns validation (vision)
  - Inputs: MobilityCorp customer images, bay ID, timestamps.
  - Outputs: accept/reject, damage tags, charger-plug bool, confidence.
  - Eval: precision > 98% for accept/reject; human-in-loop for low-confidence MobilityCorp cases.
- Rebalancing optimizer
  - Inputs: forecasted demand, vehicle locations, staff availability, battery levels.
  - Outputs: prioritized tasks and optimized routes for MobilityCorp operations.
  - Eval: A/B tests measuring fulfilled demand per shift and operational cost per rebalanced unit.
- Fraud/anomaly detection
  - Inputs: GPS patterns, unlock events, rapid movement, telemetry gaps, payment anomalies.
  - Outputs: alert level, suggested action (remote disable, manual review).
  - Eval: controlled false positives via human review; measured reduction in MobilityCorp losses.

**Engineering decisions & trade-offs**

- Real-time vs batch inference: time-critical MobilityCorp actions (unlock, disable, return validation, swap priority) use low-latency endpoints; long-range forecasts run batched to reduce cost.
- On-device inference: lightweight mobile pre-filters for images to save bandwidth; core inference on MobilityCorp servers for consistency and audit.
- Edge resiliency: vehicles and app support offline unlock tokens with short TTL signed by MobilityCorp to prevent service interruption.
- Data retention: MobilityCorp stores detailed telemetry hot for 90 days, aggregates long-term for model retraining.

**Operationalization & governance**

- CI/CD for models: tests, shadow mode, canary rollout, rollback, drift detection alerts for MobilityCorp models.
- Human-in-loop for edge cases: low-confidence vision/anomaly cases route to MobilityCorp ops humans before punitive actions.
- Explainability: thresholded rules and model explanations for high-impact MobilityCorp actions logged and recoverable.
- Monitoring: model latency, distribution shifts, and business KPIs mapped to model versions used by MobilityCorp.

- Return acceptance rate and vision-model false positive/negative.
- Time-to-resolve maintenance tickets.
- Conversion rate: ad-hoc → MobilityCorp subscription.
- Cost per fulfilled trip (including rebalancing).

**Implementation-critical constraints for MobilityCorp**

- Vehicle command latency must be bounded and auditable; MobilityCorp must provide signed tokens and retain command logs.
- Photo verification must include human review for low-confidence cases to prevent wrongful fines to MobilityCorp customers.
- GDPR-safe identifiers and opt-out for behavioral features must be implemented by MobilityCorp at design time.
- Any MobilityCorp model output used for punitive action must be explainable and reversible in system UI.

**Deployment & scaling guidance**

- Multiregion for city-level isolation: master control plane in primary region; regional data plane for low-latency MobilityCorp telemetry.
- Autoscale ingestion and model-serving clusters based on telemetry spikes.
- Use feature toggles and canary deploys for MobilityCorp behavior-affecting AI.

**Staffing & capability requirements**

- Core teams: Backend, Embedded/IoT, Mobile, Data Engineering, ML Engineering, Ops/Dispatch product owners for MobilityCorp.
- Initial ML staffing: 1 lead ML engineer, 2 data scientists for forecasting and battery models, 1 ML infra engineer.
- Runbook and on-call rotations for model drift, incidents, and vehicle control actions at MobilityCorp.

**Immediate technical deliverables (first 90 days)**

1. Secure MobilityCorp telemetry ingestion pipeline, sample dataset, schema.
1. Booking service with transactional meter and fine computation.
1. Return photo flow + manual verification dashboard for MobilityCorp.
1. Battery depletion model prototype with prioritized swap-list endpoint.
1. Staff dispatch UI integrated to swap list and route generator for MobilityCorp techs.
1. Baseline demand forecast pipeline for one MobilityCorp pilot bay cluster.

**Failure modes and mitigations for MobilityCorp**

- False disables: require multi-signal confirmation and human approval before MobilityCorp executes high-impact disables.
- Model drift causing missed demand: shadow-mode deployments and retraining schedule; automated drift alerts for MobilityCorp.
- GPS spoofing: cross-validate telemetry with cellular/Wi-Fi signatures and tamper sensors on MobilityCorp vehicles.
- Photo abuse: require geo-tag + time-signed upload + vision confidence; flag repeat offenders for manual review by MobilityCorp.

**Documented APIs (contract highlights for MobilityCorp)**

- Telemetry POST: {vehicle\_id, ts, lat, lon, soc, odo, status, signature}
- Command POST: {vehicle\_id, command, client\_id, nonce, signature} → {cmd\_id, ack\_ts}
- Swap-priority GET: {region, timestamp} → [{vehicle\_id, priority\_score, est\_empty}]
- Return-verify POST: {trip\_id, images[], bay\_id} → {status, reason, confidence}

**Cost control levers for MobilityCorp**

- Tiered inference: lightweight edge/mobile prefilters; heavy models scheduled in batch.
- Use spot/preemptible compute for non-critical batch training.
- Limit high-frequency telemetry retention; downsample after 30–90 days.

**Operational imperative for MobilityCorp**

Treat AI outputs as decision-support until measured reliable in production. Enforce human oversight for actions affecting MobilityCorp customers (fines, remote disable). Continuous measurement of MobilityCorp business KPIs must gate model-driven automation.
